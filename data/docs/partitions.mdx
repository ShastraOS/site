## Notes
- Be prepared with backups, disk partitioning will erase all your data.
- We always recommend reading Arch Linux official guide for disk partitions. [Read it here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Partitioning).

## `Erase disk` Partitioning
If you are installing ShastraOS on any virtual machine, you can easily go ahead with this type of partitioning.
Installer will erase your whole disk and install ShastraOS on it. If you want a clean ShastraOS installation, by completely removing Windows or other OS, go with this partitioning. You will also have an option to create 8gb swap or 16gb swap with hibernate.

---

## `Install along side` Partitioning
You will get the option to install ShastraOS along with your previous OS. It will create an option to edit the existing partition and create a separate partition of ShastraOS on the same disk.

---

## `Replace a Partition` Partitioning
You will get the option to replace a partition on the selected disk. The partition you selected will get formated and ShastraOS will get installed on that.

---

## `Manual Partition` Partitioning
Here comes the scary part where you can easily get your things messed up. So we always recommend reading the documentation properly.

If you have an empty disk. Create a Partition table. For UEFI, use the GPT partition table and for BIOS, use MBR.
If you already have some partitions, and dont want to delete your existing data. You dont need to create the partition table.
You need atleast 64gb to move ahead and make custom partitions.

### Boot Partition
- Select the `512gb` from free space
- File system to be `fat32`
- Mount point should be `boot/efi` for UEFI
- Mount point should be `boot` for GPT
- FS Label `efi`
- Flags `boot`

### Swap Partition
We recommend creating swap if you have less than 16gb of RAM.
- Select the `8gb` from free space if (it depends how much space you have and how much less ram you have)
- File system to be `linuxswap`
- FS Label `swap`
- Flags `swap`

### Root Partition
- Select atleast `48gb` from free space (If you have more disk space you can increase it upto 100gb. And if you not want to create a separate home partition, give left over space to root partition.)
- File system to be `ext4`
- If you want to encrypt you disk with password you can tick `encrypt`
- Mount point should be `/`
- FS Label `root`
- Flags `root`

### Home Partition
It is not necessary, but we recommend creating a separate home partition.
- Select rest of the disk space you have left.
- File system to be `ext4`
- If you want to encrypt you disk with password you can tick `encrypt`
- Mount point should be `/home`
- FS Label `home`
