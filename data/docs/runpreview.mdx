### What is Preview
**Very first version of ShastraOS for testing and prototyping**\
ShastraOS Preview is non-installer Release, means you will not able to install the image file into your system. This is built for general testing and bug fixing.

## Download ISO file
You can download ShastraOS from [OSDN (recommended)](https://osdn.net/projects/shastraos/downloads/77132/ShastraOS-preview-2022.11.15-x86_64.iso/) or Sourceforge mirrors.

## Verify your ShastraOS ISO file
While you can just download a ShastraOS ISO image, can you be really sure that it's the right file? With a few simple steps, you can verify the integrity of any ShastraOS ISO. Here's how to do it.

### Displaying the Checksum for a File
To calculate an `SHA256` checksum on a downloaded ISO file, use this `SHA265` command.
```bash
md5sum -b 'filename'
```
For a `MD5` checksum, use `MD5` instead with the same `-b` option

### Here are the checksums for iso file `ShastraOS-preview-2022.11.15-x86_64.iso`

`File Size 2,433,183,744 bytes`\
`MD5 52b0380ca77487fdc88c2b78617e59a9`\
`SHA1 d901e6957c0c44723a642edec6dff47461d3cfb9`\
`SHA256 9ed21a7ad2d905199e4027b087c113985e8fae937e8ef8fe9e19c3b89bb13306`

## Booting iso file using USB drive

Use Software Balena Etcher (For Linux Users) and Rufus (For Windows Users).\
You can also use Ventoy (On other device)\
After Booting ISO file, your system will be loaded.
